  <h3>What's Nu? Newsletter</h3>
  <ul>
    <p>The newsletter is a record of important events of the last year in the Math and Computer Science department. It is sent to alumni and prospective students so they have an idea of what the department has done.
       The newsletter was started in 2005 by Dr. Fred Portier. Over the years there have been several articles on the history of the department and articles from alumni of what they do after graduation.
       Articles are written by students and faculty members. These articles can be submitted to Dr.Heinold, who is the editor of the newsletter.
